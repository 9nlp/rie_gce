Hence , polB regulation by AraC may be widely conserved .
Lrp was also found to be involved in the regulation of cadBA expression .
Nystrom showed that induction of the RelA protein results in high expression of eda ( 47 ).
First , repression of nanC and fimB divergent transcripts by NagC has been observed both in vivo and in vitro [ 32 ] .
This stimulates us to examine the possibility that GntR is also involved in the expressional regulation of the GntII genes .
( 2000 ) Transcription activation at the Escherichia coli melAB promoter : the role of MelR and the cyclic AMP receptor protein .
Repression of the Escherichia coli melR promoter by MelR : evidence that efficient repression requires the formation of a repression loop .
The expression of ptsG is controlled by Mlc binding to two operators upstream of two promoters , both of which are subject to Mlc repression .
The mechanism of IciA protein stimulation of transcription from dnaA promoter 1P in the presence of inhibitory amounts of DnaA protein was examined .
Table 1 shows that two amino acid residues of 70 R4 are required for Rob - dependent activation of fumC and that only one is required for activation of micF .
Sufficiency of Rob for in vitro transcriptional activation of zwf , fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA , promoters known to be activated by MalE - SoxS and MarA .
The binding of NarL or NarP to the nir promoter displaces IHF and overrides the repression of FNR - dependent activation by IHF and Fis ( Browning et al . , 2004 ) .
